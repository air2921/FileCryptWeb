# FileCryptWeb

*The FileCrypt web project is designed to securely encrypt user data and securely transfer encryption keys.*

*For strong encryption we use the AES256 algorithm with your unique signature*

*No storage or analysis of the content of your files*

## Key Features

* *Open API for use by third party services*

* *Encryption keys are stored in encrypted form*

* *Encryption any files without saving them on the server or in the cloud*

* *Authentication data such as tokens and passwords are stored in hashed form*

* *Secure exchange of encryption keys between users, without using third-party services*

* *Secure store encryption keys in a vault. It is possible to add an access code for the storage, and an encryption flag for the keys inside the storage*
